Things to do:

* Allow overridable configs

  * index.js will allow a command line parameter to pick the config
  
* Implement IRC command interface
  * seen: Splunk search for the last time we've seen the nick mentioned.  Print to IRC and provide link to a web interface that shows their last few conversations

  * Web interface which provides statistics by channel, with sparklines and timechart graphs of activity
  * Allows easy searching of history etc
    * Allow a slider which allows searches to expand to a grep list -<num> view... they will default see 2 events around it but allow expandability to 5 or 10 lines so they can see the conversation around it
    * Clicking on a time should give a log like view to the events for a few minutes surrounding that time
  * Web interface provides analytics for the channel
